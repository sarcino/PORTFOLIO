        <h1>Hi, I'm Šárka</h1>
        <p>These are some of my projects: creations that bring me joy
            while letting me learn new things.</p>
        <p>I specialize in designs that look good and work well—with both visuals and accessibility in mind. No effects
            for
            effects' sake; but cool, responsive and intuitive designs that get the message across and make the web a
            more welcoming
            place for everyone.</p>
        <p>Have an interesting proposal? I'm listening.</p>
